                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive 
                        (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).<br />There are also more advanced 
                        server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website 
                        than simply downloading files<br />(such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a 
                        host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its<br />environment 
                        to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of 
                        language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.<br />Core JavaScript can be extended 
                        for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its 
                            Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side<br />extensions allow an application to place elements 
                            on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript 
                            on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an<br />application to communicate with a database, 
                            provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file 
                            manipulations on a server.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites.<br />
                        It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is incredibly versatile and beginner friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive<br />
                        database-driven apps, and much more!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very flexible. Developers have written a large variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast<br />
                        amount of extra functionality with minimum effort.

                <header>Hello World</header>
                <article>
                    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write your first 
                        "Hello world" JavaScript code:<code>(function() {
    "use strict";
    function greetMe(yourName) {
        alert('Hello ' + yourName);
    }                      
    greetMe('World');
})();</code>
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        In the following pages, this guide introduces you to the JavaScript syntax and language features, so that you will be able to write more complex applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But for now, remember to always include the <code>(function() {
    "use strict"; //before your code, and add
})();</code> to the end of your code. You will learn what these mean,<br />
                        but for now they can be thought of as doing the following:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Massively improve performance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Prevent stupid semantics in JavaScript that trip up beginners.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Prevent code snippets executed in the console from interacting with one-another (e.g., having<br />something created in one console execution being used for a different console execution).
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </article>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                <header>Variables</header>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).
                     </p>
                    <p>
                        Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                     </p>
                    <p>
                        You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. (For more details, see this blog post.) You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.
                     </p>
                    <p>
                        Some examples of legal names are: <code>Number_hits</code><code>temp99</code><code>$credit</code><code>_name</code>
